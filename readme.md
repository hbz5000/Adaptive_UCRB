## Abstract
The Colorado-Big Thompson (CBT) project enables Northern Water to divert up to 310k AF of water from the Colorado River Basin to support over 1 million residents and 600k irrigated acres in Northeastern Colorado, but annual deliveries are highly variable. Although permanent transfers are subject to costly and slow legal review, informal transfers can be used by trans-basin diverters to supplement dry-year supplies. We use StateMod, the State of Coloradoâ€™s Decision Support System, to evaluate the institutional capacity for adaptive demand coordination to increase dry year trans-basin diversions.
